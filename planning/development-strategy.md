# Development Strategy

## Overview

The development strategy outlines the approach to be taken for building the joke application. It includes the division of tasks, version control, testing procedures.

## Task Division

Tasks will be divided among team members based on their skills and expertise. The following task categories will be defined:

1. **Frontend Development**: Tasks related to building the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Backend Development**: Tasks related to implementing server-side logic, APIs, and database management.
3. **Testing**: Tasks related to writing and executing tests to ensure application functionality and reliability.
4. **Documentation**: Tasks related to writing project documentation, including README files, code comments, and user guides.

## Version Control

Version control will be managed using Git, and the repository will be hosted on a platform like GitHub or GitLab. The following practices will be followed:

- **Feature Branching**: Each feature or task will have its own branch, which will be merged into the main branch upon completion.
- **Pull Requests**: Changes will be reviewed through pull requests before merging into the main branch.
- **Commit Messages**: Descriptive commit messages will be used to track changes and provide context.

## Testing

Testing will be an integral part of the development process to ensure code quality and functionality.
